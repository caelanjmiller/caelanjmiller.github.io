## Education

---
2023 - Present&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Ph.D. Student in Computational & Systems Biology**. Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.

2017 - 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**B.A. in Biology: Microbiology**. Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.

## Research Experience

---
2021 - 2023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Laboratory Technician**. PI: Dr. Lucia Strader. Department of Biology. Duke University. Durham, NC.

- Cloned 70,000 *Arabidopsis thaliana* transcription factor fragments into inducible expression constructs to characterize activation domain sequences and structural motifs.

- Built the *Arabidopsis thaliana* Activation Domain (ATAD) CLI Tool, allowing users to query a database of activation scores for nearly 1,900 *Arabidopsis thaliana* transcription factors.

- Built the *Arabidopsis thaliana* Activation Domain (ATAD) Viewer, as a web app alternative to the ATAD CLI Tool.

2020-2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Laboratory Technician**. PI: Dr. Rebecca Bart. Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. St. Louis, MO.

- Cloned host eIF4E susceptibility factors into inducible expression constructs to aid in the characterization of their roles in Cassava brown streak disease.

2020-2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Undergraduate Research Fellow**. PI: Dr. Chris Shaffer. Department of Biology. Washington University in St. Louis. St. Louis, MO.

- Utilized the gene annotation workflow tool PECAAN to annotate the genome of Streptomyces phage Targaryen. Submitted to NCBI GenBank.

2019-2020&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Undergraduate Research Fellow**. PI: Dr. Ian Duncan. Department of Biology. Washington University in St. Louis. St. Louis, MO.

- Cloned enhancer elements into inducible expression constructs to assess their potential modulation of E93 expression in Drosophila.

2018-2019&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Undergraduate Research Fellow**. PI: Dr. Sarah C. R. Elgin. Department of Biology. Washington University in St. Louis. St. Louis, MO.

- Annotated Drosophila D and F element genes to utilize phylogenetic footprinting to search for gene regulatory motifs specific to heterochromatic F element genes.

- Facilitated a large genetic screen identifying genes required for repeat-induced heterochromatin formation in Drosophila melanogaster.

2017-2018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Undergraduate Student**. PI: Dr. Chris Shaffer. BIO 191 & 192. Department of Biology. Washington University in St. Louis. St. Louis, MO.

- Isolated and purified the novel Streptomyces phage Circinus from St. Louis soil samples. Utilized the gene annotation workflow tool PECAAN to annotate its genome. Submitted to NCBI GenBank.
